== Getting the latest version ==

Download the latest package from the downloads page:

    https://bitbucket.org/kliment/apollota/downloads


== Building ==

Apollota has no required external dependencies, only
a standard-compliant C++ compiler is needed to build it.

For example, "apollota" executable can be built from
the sources in "src" directory using GNU C++ compiler:

    g++ -O3 -o apollota src/*.cpp

To enable the usage of OpenMP for parallel processing,
add "-fopenmp" option when buiding:

    g++ -O3 -fopenmp -o apollota src/*.cpp

To enable the usage of MPI for parallel processing, you
can use mpic++ compiler wrapper. You also need to define
"ENABLE_MPI" macro when buiding:

    mpic++ -O3 -fopenmp -DENABLE_MPI -o apollota ./src/*.cpp
    
You can also build using cmake for makefile generation.
Starting in the directory containing "CMakeLists.txt" file,
run the sequence of commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make


== Getting usage help ==

Usage help is displayed when executing Apollota without any
parameters or with "--help" command line option:

    ./apollota --help
